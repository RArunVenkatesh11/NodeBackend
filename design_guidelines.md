# InnooRyze MMA - Backend-Only Project

## No Design Guidelines Required

This project is explicitly defined as a **backend-only REST API** with no frontend components. As stated in your requirements:

❌ No frontend, React, Vite, HTML, CSS, or TypeScript files
❌ No /client, /public, /pages, /dist, /build, or any UI code

### Project Scope
- Pure Node.js Express API
- REST endpoints only (JSON responses)
- Supabase database integration
- OpenAI API integration for assessment analysis

### What This Means
Since this is a backend-only service, there are no visual design elements, layouts, typography, or UI components to specify. The API will serve JSON data that can be consumed by any frontend application built separately.

### If You Need Frontend Design Later
When you decide to build a frontend application that consumes this API, you can request design guidelines at that time for:
- Assessment form interfaces
- Results dashboard
- User onboarding flows
- PDF report layouts

**Current deliverable:** Pure backend API as specified - no design guidelines applicable.
